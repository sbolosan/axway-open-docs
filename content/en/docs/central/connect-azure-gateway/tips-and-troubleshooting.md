## Troubleshooting

| Question                                                   | Answer                                                                                                                                                                       |   |
|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Why can't Discovery Agent connect to Azure Gateway?    | Make sure that the Azure configuration (Subscription, tenantID and service principal) are correct.                     |   |
| Why can't Traceability Agent connect to Azure event hub? | Make sure that the Azure configuration (Subscription, tenantID and service principal) are correct.                          |   |
| Why can't my agents connect to Amplify Central?            | Go to Amplify Central UI > Access > Service Accounts and make sure that the Service Account is correctly named and valid. Make sure that the organizationID and team are correct. |   |
| I have the following error: `Amplify Central - FAIL (error creating request header. bad response from AxwayId: 400 Bad Request)`| Make sure that the Service Account set up is properly spelled (refer to `central.clientId` property). Verify that the public/private key pair is the one corresponding to the Service Account |   |
| Why don't I see traffic in Amplify Central?                | Make sure that the Condor URL is accessible from the machine where Traceability Agent is installed.                                                                          |   |
| Why isn't my agent status displayed in the environment details page?   | It is possible that your agents and their corresponding resources are not linked together. Follow [this procedure](/docs/central/env_gw_mgmt/environment_agent_resources) to ensure the correct usage of agent resources. |   |

## Limitations

* Azure versioning not taken into account while discovering APIs
* Discovery Agent is not able to send credentials to subscribers
